# Quakejs Docker-Compose Server

This readme details the steps I took to getting a local QuakeJS server up and running for my studenets to play at the end of term. Before they get to play, they have to complete a MS forms quiz and get 100% in order to get the IP address of the server. It's based on the docker image built [here](https://github.com/treyyoder/quakejs-docker) but with a few tweaks to make it easy for you to edit server configuration or add additional maps if you have them.

## Requirements
A working knowledge of Linux.
A device that can spare around 500mb for the server. A raspberry Pi 3 or 4 is plenty or an old laptop running Linux is fine too.
An Office 365 account if you want to complete the quiz. You can access this quiz [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=FoOZLkRWgUSl8Knlv-UI-bM2I8a4l0tBqu1okXYOIv9UMlFQSzBUVVBGQTFXTUg0NzdFNVVMWDhYTC4u&sharetoken=TcCwXyZs4vsYQtxG1poo).
